# Python
I am documenting my journey along the Python for Everybody specialisation on Coursera offered by University of Michigan.
This can be accessed and referred by students who are going through the same course and are stuck somewhere in some problem
but my advice would be to only try to understand the approach and come up with a solution of your own, otherwise it defeats the
purpose of Dr Chuck's initiative.
